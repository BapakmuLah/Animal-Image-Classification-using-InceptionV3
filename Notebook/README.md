there's 4 notebooks here: <br>

**AnimalsClassification.ipynb** is my first notebook created. I use _CNN Architecture_ to train and build the model. <br>
**AnimalsClassification[UPDATE].ipynb** is my Second notebook. This notebook is an improvement on the previous notebook and adds addition code. <br>
**image_Augmentation.ipynb** This is a notebook that shows how data augmentation works. <br>
**Classification-with-InceptionV3.ipynb** In this notebook we use the pre-trained InceptionV3 model to build and train the model.
